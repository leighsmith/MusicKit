<title><productname>MusicKit</productname> and
<productname>SndKit</productname> System Overview</title>

<para><productname>MusicKit</productname> application programs are
written in the Objective-C language, an extension to C that adds
object-oriented concepts to the language.  The software kits define a
number of <emphasis>classes</emphasis>, or object templates, that you
can use in your own applications.  The software kits currently
provided by the MusicKit Project are:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>The <productname>SndKit</productname>
<!-- trademark -->
 for adding sounds to your application.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>The <productname>MusicKit</productname>
<!-- trademark --> for music composition, synthesis, and performance.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>The <productname>SndKit</productname> and
<productname>MusicKit</productname>s use the
<hardware>MC56001</hardware> digital signal processor (the
<acronym>DSP</acronym>) as a sound synthesizer.
Objects in these kits communicate with the <acronym>DSP</acronym> by
calling functions in the <acronym>DSP</acronym> system library.  In
addition to establishing and managing a channel of communication
between your application and the <acronym>DSP</acronym>, the functions
in the <acronym>DSP</acronym> system library also provide diagnostic
capabilities and data conversion routines.</para>

<title>Sound and Music Overview</title>

<para>The <productname>MusicKit</productname> and
<productname>SndKit</productname> provide a useful system for creating
and manipulating sound and music.  The software for this system is
divided into two kits, the kit that you need depends on the demands of
your application:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>The <productname>SndKit</productname> lets you
incorporate prerecorded sound effects into your application and
provides easy access to the microphone input so you can record your
own sounds.  The objects in the <productname>SndKit</productname> let
you examine and manipulate sound data with microscopic
precision.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>The <productname>MusicKit</productname> provides
tools for composing, storing, and performing music.  It lets you
communicate with external synthesizers as well as create your own
software instruments.  Like the <productname>SndKit</productname>, the
<productname>MusicKit</productname> provides objects that create and
manipulate sounds with exquisite detail; but more important, the Music
Kit helps you organize and arrange groups of sounds so you can design
a performance.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<sect2 id="TheSndKitOverview">
<title>The <productname>SndKit</productname></title>

<!-- This sucks --> <para>Many sound recordings, stored in files on
the disk (called <emphasis>soundfiles</emphasis>), are now available.
Through the <productname>SndKit</productname>, you can access these
files and incorporate the sounds into your application.  It's also
straightforward to record new sounds into a computer.  With a single
message to the <productname>SndKit</productname>'s
<classname>Snd</classname> object, you can record your own sound
through a microphone.  Sound playback is just as simple: Another
message and the sound is played to the stereo output jacks on your
computer or sound-card.</para>

<para>When you record a sound using the <classname>Snd</classname>
object, a series of audio &ldquo;snapshots&rdquo; or
<emphasis>samples</emphasis> is created.  By storing sound as samples,
you can analyze and manipulate your sound data with an almost
unlimited degree of precision.  The <classname>SndView</classname>
class lets you see your sounds by displaying the samples in a
window.</para>

<para>While the <productname>SndKit</productname> is designed
primarily for use on sampled data, you can also use it to send
instructions to the <acronym>DSP</acronym>.  The speed of the
<acronym>DSP</acronym> makes it an ideal sound synthesizer and, in
general, <acronym>DSP</acronym> instructions take up much less space
than sampled data.  The <classname>Snd</classname> object manages
the details of playing sounds for you, so you needn't be aware of
whether a particular <classname>Snd</classname> contains samples or
<acronym>DSP</acronym> instructions.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="TheMusicKit">
<title>The <productname>MusicKit</productname></title>

<para>The <productname>MusicKit</productname> provides a number of
ways to compose and perform music.  By attaching an external
synthesizer keyboard to a serial port, you can play a computer as
a musical instrument.  Alternatively, you can compose music to be
played by the computer by creating music data in a text editor or by
creating an algorithm that generates it automatically.  These
approaches can be combined in performance.  For instance, a musician
can use an external keyboard to trigger precomposed events, allowing
the computer to create sounds and gestures that are impossible on a
traditional instrument, but at moments specified by the
performer.</para>

<para>The <productname>MusicKit</productname> helps you construct
applications that create, organize, process, and render music data.
The Objective-C language classes provided by the Kit fall into three
categories:</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Data representation</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>Synthesis</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>Performance</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>

<sect3 id="DataRepresentation">
<title>Data Representation</title>

<para>The data representation classes, illustrated in <xref linkend="Figure1-2">, are
used to encapsulate and organize music data.</para>

</figure>

<para><classname>MKNote</classname>s, <classname>MKPart</classname>s,
and <classname>MKScore</classname>s form the core of music
representation.  Of paramount importance is the
<classname>MKNote</classname> class: A <classname>MKNote</classname>
object represents a musical note as a list of attributes, such as
frequency, amplitude, and duration.  Music applications use
<classname>MKNote</classname> objects as a common currency: They're
the basic package of musical information upon which the other objects
act.  <classname>MKPart</classname> and <classname>MKScore</classname>
objects, as their names suggest, provide a means for organizing
<classname>MKNote</classname> objects.  The other data classes,
<classname>MKEnvelope</classname>, <classname>MKWaveTable</classname>
(and its progeny), and <classname>MKTuningSystem</classname>, are
designed to help define <classname>MKNote</classname> object
attributes:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><classname>MKEnvelope</classname>s represent
time-varying functions that can be used to continuously control the
values of a <classname>MKNote</classname>'s attributes (such as its
amplitude and frequency).</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para> A <classname>MKWaveTable</classname> contains timbral
information that's used during music synthesis on the
<acronym>DSP</acronym>.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para> A <classname>MKTuningSystem</classname> is a mapping
of pitch names to specific frequencies, allowing an easy
representation of alternate tunings.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>The <productname>MusicKit</productname> defines an
<acronym>ASCII</acronym> file format called
<emphasis>scorefile</emphasis> that represents the music data objects
as editable text in files on a disk.  A few C-like programming
constructs, such as variables and arithmetic operators, can be used in
a scorefile to help create and fine-tune music data.  You can also
store music data as a Standard <acronym>MIDI</acronym> File.</para>

</sect3>
<sect3 id="SynthesisOverview">
<title>Synthesis</title>

<para>Synthesizing music is potentially the most technically involved
of the three <productname>MusicKit</productname> areas.  At the
easiest level, you can use and manipulate the software instruments,
called <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>es, that are provided by the
<productname>MusicKit</productname>.  A
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> subclass corresponds, roughly, to
a voice preset on a <acronym>MIDI</acronym> synthesizer.  However, the
<productname>MusicKit</productname>
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>es are generally less confined than
most <acronym>MIDI</acronym> presets: An enormously wide variety of
sounds can be produced by the <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>es
supplied by the <productname>MusicKit</productname> simply by varying
the attributes of the <classname>MKNote</classname>s that they
receive.</para>

<para>At a lower lever, you can design your own
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> subclasses by interconnecting
<acronym>DSP</acronym> synthesis modules that the
<productname>MusicKit</productname> provides as objects called
<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>s.  Finally, at the lowest
level, you can design <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>s yourself
by writing <hardware>MC56000</hardware> assembly language macros and
using the <command>dspwrap</command> tool to turn the macros into
subclasses of <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>.  This last level
falls below the boundary of the <productname>MusicKit</productname>
and is described in <ulink url="ProgrammingTheDSP">Programming the
<acronym>DSP</acronym></ulink>. The principal
<productname>MusicKit</productname> synthesis classes are shown in
<xref linkend="Figure1-3">.</para>

</figure>

<para>The <classname>MKSynthInstrument</classname> class isn't
strictly part of the synthesis machinery.  However, it provides an
easy way to allocate and control <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>
objects.</para>

<para>An additional class, not shown in the illustration above, is
<classname>MKOrchestra</classname>.  An
<classname>MKOrchestra</classname> represents an entire
<acronym>DSP</acronym>; the standard configuration includes a single
<acronym>DSP</acronym>, thus most applications will create but a
single <classname>MKOrchestra</classname> object.  It's through an
<classname>MKOrchestra</classname> that all synthesis resources, such
as <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>s and
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>es, are allocated.</para>

</sect3>
<sect3 id="Performance">
<title>Performance</title>

<para>During a <productname>MusicKit</productname> performance,
<classname>MKNote</classname> objects are acquired, scheduled, and
rendered (or <emphasis>realized</emphasis>).  These functions are
embodied by objects of the <classname>MKPerformer</classname>,
<classname>MKConductor</classname>, and
<classname>MKInstrument</classname> classes:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><classname>MKPerformer</classname> objects acquire
<classname>MKNote</classname>s.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>Through messages scheduled with a
<classname>MKConductor</classname> object, a
<classname>MKPerformer</classname> forwards each
<classname>MKNote</classname> it acquires to one or more
<classname>MKInstrument</classname>s.  The
<classname>MKConductor</classname> thus controls the tempo of the
performance.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>An <classname>MKInstrument</classname> receives
<classname>MKNote</classname>s that are sent to it by a
<classname>MKPerformer</classname> and realizes them in some manner,
typically by synthesizing them on the <acronym>DSP</acronym> or by
sending them to an external <acronym>MIDI</acronym> instrument.  Other
types of realization include writing <classname>MKNote</classname>s to
a scorefile or adding them to a <classname>MKPart</classname>.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para><classname>MKPerformer</classname> and
<classname>MKInstrument</classname> are abstract classes; each
subclass specifies a particular means of <classname>MKNote</classname>
acquisition or realization.  The <productname>MusicKit</productname>
provides a number of <classname>MKPerformer</classname> and
<classname>MKInstrument</classname> subclasses.
</para>

<productname>MusicKit</productname> performance.</para>

<para>In addition to the <classname>MKPerformer</classname>,
<classname>MKConductor</classname>, and
<classname>MKInstrument</classname> classes described above, five
other classes are included in <xref linkend="Figure1-4">:
<classname>MKNoteSender</classname>,
<classname>MKNoteReceiver</classname>,
<classname>MKNoteFilter</classname>,
<classname>MKSynthInstrument</classname>, and
<classname>MKMidi</classname>.
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><classname>MKNoteSender</classname> and
<classname>MKNoteReceiver</classname> objects are part of the
implementation of <classname>MKPerformer</classname> and
<classname>MKInstrument</classname>: They're the ports through which
<classname>MKNote</classname>s are sent by
<classname>MKPerformer</classname>s and received by
<classname>MKInstrument</classname>s.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>A <classname>MKNoteFilter</classname> is a
<classname>MKPerformer</classname>/<classname>MKInstrument</classname>
hybrid; while it inherits from <classname>MKInstrument</classname>, it
also implements <classname>MKPerformer</classname> protocol.  Thus, it
can receive <classname>MKNote</classname>s like an
<classname>MKInstrument</classname> and then send them on to other
<classname>MKInstrument</classname>s, like a
<classname>MKPerformer</classname>.
<classname>MKNoteFilter</classname>s are interposed between
<classname>MKPerformer</classname>s and
<classname>MKInstrument</classname>s and act as
<classname>MKNote</classname>-processing modules.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para><classname>MKSynthInstrument</classname> is a subclass
of <classname>MKInstrument</classname> that causes
<classname>MKNote</classname>s to be realized on the
<acronym>DSP</acronym>.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>A <classname>MKMidi</classname> object represents an
external <acronym>MIDI</acronym> synthesizer that's attached to a
computer through one of the serial ports.  It can receive as well as
send <acronym>MIDI</acronym> signals from and to the synthesizer it
represents.  While it inherits neither from
<classname>MKPerformer</classname> nor
<classname>MKInstrument</classname>, it implements their protocols and
contains <classname>MKNoteSender</classname>s and
<classname>MKNoteReceiver</classname>s.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>A number of other <classname>MKPerformer</classname> and
<classname>MKInstrument</classname> subclasses are provided by the
<productname>MusicKit</productname>.  During a
<productname>MusicKit</productname> performance, performance objects
can be dynamically connected and reconnected.  This allows you to mix
and match <classname>MKNote</classname> sources with any means of
realization.  For example, the <acronym>MIDI</acronym> signals sent
from an external <acronym>MIDI</acronym> synthesizer are automatically
converted to <classname>MKNote</classname> objects by a
<classname>MKMidi</classname> object.  The
<classname>MKNote</classname>s can then be sent to a
<classname>MKSynthInstrument</classname> for realization on the
<acronym>DSP</acronym>, or written to a scorefile by a
<classname>MKScorefileWriter</classname>
<classname>MKInstrument</classname>.</para>
