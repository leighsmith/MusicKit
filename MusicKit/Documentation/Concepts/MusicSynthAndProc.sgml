  <title>Music Synthesis and Processing</title>

<para>In this document &ldquo;synthesis&rdquo; refers to creating
sound from scratch, while &ldquo;processing&rdquo; refers to modifying
sound from elsewhere.  However, the MusicKit provides a unified model
of synthesis and processing.  Thus, nearly all operations that apply
to synthesis can also be used in sound processing.</para>

<para>There are four levels of MusicKit classes involved in
synthesizing and processing music on the DSP:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>At the top level is the
<classname>MKSynthInstrument</classname> class; an inheritor from
Instrument, it provides an interface between the MusicKit performance
mechanism and DSP synthesis/processing.  A
<classname>MKSynthInstrument</classname> distributes
<classname>MKNote</classname>s that it receives during a performance
to individual <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> objects that control
the actual synthesis/processing.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>, an abstract
class, embodies the principles of music synthesis.  Each subclass of
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> represents a particular
synthesis/processing strategy; each
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> object synthesizes one
<classname>MKNote</classname> at a time, using the strategy defined by
its class.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname> class is
also abstract; each of its subclasses represents a signal processing
function that runs on the DSP.  These are the basic building blocks of
music synthesis/processing that a <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>
subclass configures to define its synthesis/processing strategy.  At
the same level as <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname> is the
<classname>MKSynthData</classname> class.  Instances of
<classname>MKSynthData</classname> represent portions of DSP memory
that hold synthesis/processing data such as wavetables and delay
memory.  In addition, <classname>MKSynthData</classname> objects are
used to transmit data between <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>
objects.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The <classname>MKOrchestra</classname> represents the
DSP itself.  It manages the allocation of DSP resources and controls
communication between the DSP and the host.  Requests for use of the
DSP are always made through messages to the
<classname>MKOrchestra</classname>; this includes requests made by a
<classname>MKSynthInstrument</classname> for more
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>es, and those of a
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> for
<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>s and
<classname>MKSynthData</classname> objects.</para></listitem>

<para>The <classname>MKSynthInstrument</classname> class is described in <xref
linkend="MusicPerformance">. The rest of this chapter is devoted to
the other classes listed above.</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="TheMKOrchestraClass">
<title>The <classname>MKOrchestra</classname> Class</title>

<para>The <classname>MKOrchestra</classname> class manages DSP
resources used in music synthesis/processing.  Each instance of
<classname>MKOrchestra</classname> represents a single DSP; in the
basic NeXT configuration, there's only one DSP so you create only one
<classname>MKOrchestra</classname> object.</para>

<para>The methods defined by the <classname>MKOrchestra</classname>
class let you manage a DSP by allocating portions of its memory for
specific synthesis/processing modules and by setting its processing
characteristics.</para>

<para>You can allocate entire <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>es or
individual <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname> and
<classname>MKSynthData</classname> objects through
<classname>MKOrchestra</classname> methods.  Primary among these
are:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">allocSynthPatch:</emphasis>
allocates an instance of the given <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>
subclass.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">allocUnitGenerator:</emphasis>
does the same for a <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>
subclass.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><emphasis
role="bold">allocSynthData:length:</emphasis> allocates a portion of
DSP memory of a given length.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Keep in mind, however, that similar methods defined in other
classes&horbar;specifically, the <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>
allocation methods defined in
<classname>MKSynthInstrument</classname>, and the
<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname> and
<classname>MKSynthData</classname> allocation methods defined in
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>&horbar;are built upon and designed
to usurp the allocation methods defined by
<classname>MKOrchestra</classname>.  You only to need to allocate
synthesis/processing objects directly if you want to assemble
sound-making modules at a low level.</para>

<sect2 id="InteractivityVersusDependability">
<title>Interactivity versus Dependability</title>

<para>Different applications have different needs. When playing a
sequence or scorefile, it is essential that the timing of the notes be
precise and a bit of latency is tolerable. On the other hand, when
playing the DSP from a <acronym>MIDI</acronym> keyboard, the critical element is to keep
response time to a minimum. In the first case, you should set the
<classname>MKOrchestra</classname> to &ldquo;timed mode&rdquo; by sending
<emphasis role="bold">[orchestra setTimed:YES]</emphasis>, while in
the second case, you should set the <classname>MKOrchestra</classname>
to &ldquo;untimed mode&rdquo; by sending <emphasis role="bold">[orchestra
setTimed:NO]</emphasis>.  In addition, when performing from a
keyboard, you should call <emphasis
role="bold">MKSetRealTimeEnvelopes(YES)</emphasis> before allocating
your <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>es.  This has the effect of
setting the MusicKit <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>es to use a
version of the envelope handler that is best-suited to the interactive
situation. Actually, <emphasis
role="bold">MKSetRealTimeEnvelopes(YES)</emphasis> may be used for
either case; its only drawback is that it does not allow for
arbitrarily long envelopes. In timed mode, the fixed latency is set by
the function <emphasis role="bold">MKSetDeltaT()</emphasis>.  For
example, <emphasis role="bold">MKSetDeltaT(.1)</emphasis> sets a fixed
latency of a tenth of a second.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="SharingAllocations">
<title>Sharing Allocations</title>

<para>To avoid creating duplicate synthesis/processing modules on the
DSP, each instance of <classname>MKOrchestra</classname> maintains a
shared object table.  Objects on the table are
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>es,
<classname>MKSynthData</classname>s, and
<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>s; each is indexed by some other
object that represents the shared object.  For example, the OscgafUG
<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname> (a family of oscillators) lets
you specify its waveform-generating wave table as a
<classname>MKPartials</classname> object (you can also set it as a
Samples object; for the purposes of this example we only consider the
<classname>MKPartials</classname> case).  When its wave table is set
through the <emphasis role="bold">setTable:length:</emphasis> method,
the oscillator allocates a <classname>MKSynthData</classname> object
from the <classname>MKOrchestra</classname> to represent the DSP
memory that will hold the waveform data computed from the
<classname>MKPartials</classname>.  It also places the
<classname>MKSynthData</classname> on the shared object table using
the <classname>MKPartials</classname> as an index by sending the
message</para>

<programlisting>
[MKOrchestra installSharedSynthData: theSynthData for: thePartials];
</programlisting>

<para>If another oscillator's wave table is set as the same
<classname>MKPartials</classname> object, the already allocated
<classname>MKSynthData</classname> can be returned by sending the
message:</para>

<programlisting>
id aSynthData = [MKOrchestra sharedObjectFor: thePartials];
</programlisting>

<para>The method <emphasis
role="bold">installSharedObject:for:</emphasis> is provided for
installing <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>es and
<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>s.</para>

<sect2 id="OrchestrasDeviceStatus">
<title>Orchestra's Device Status</title>

<para>Before you can do anything with an
<classname>MKOrchestra</classname>&horbar;particularly, before you can
allocate synthesis/processing objects&horbar;you must create and open
it.  As usual, creation is done through the <emphasis
role="bold">alloc</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">init</emphasis>
methods; to open an <classname>MKOrchestra</classname>, you send it
the <emphasis role="bold">open</emphasis> message.  This provides a
channel of communication with the DSP that the
<classname>MKOrchestra</classname> represents.  The DSP can be opened
by only one application at a time, so you should always check the
value returned by open; the method returns <emphasis
role="bold">nil</emphasis> if the DSP couldn't be opened.</para>

<para>Once you've allocated the objects that you want, either through
the methods described above or through those defined by
<classname>MKSynthInstrument</classname> and
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>, you can start the
synthesis/processing by sending the <emphasis
role="bold">run</emphasis> message to the
<classname>MKOrchestra</classname>.  The <emphasis
role="bold">stop</emphasis> method halts synthesis/processing and
<emphasis role="bold">close</emphasis> breaks communication with the
DSP.  These methods change the <classname>MKOrchestra</classname>'s
status, which is always one of the following MKDeviceStatus
values:</para>

<para>When the <classname>MKOrchestra</classname> is running it

<sect2 id="UsingTheDSPSerialPort">
<title>Using the DSP Serial Port</title>

<para>One of the most powerful aspects of the MusicKit is its seamless
integration with the NeXT DSP serial port.  There are three main uses
for the serial port:</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Direct to DAT transfers of sound in or out of the MusicKit</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>For very high quality digital-to-analog conversion.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>For high quality analog-to-digital conversion.</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>The standard NeXT configuration (at the time of this writing)
does not include a high-quality sound input.  Therefore, in order to
do real-time high-quality sound processing, you need to obtain a
device that plugs into the DSP serial port.  Similarly, you may want
to use the DSP serial port for high-quality sound output to an
outboard digital-to-analog converter or for direct digital transfer to
or from a DAT machine.</para>

<para>A number of such devices are commercially available.
Metaresearch sells the DigitalEars, an analog-to-digital converter.
Ariel has an analog-to-digital converter called the Digital
Microphone.  Ariel also sells the ProPort analog-to-digital and
digital-to-analog converter, as well as the DatPort DAT interface.
Stealth sells the DAI2400 DAT interface.  Singular Solutions sells the
AD64x, which is a combination analog-to-digital converter and DAT
interface.</para>

<para>To set up the <classname>MKOrchestra</classname> to do sound
input via the DSP serial port, you send it the message:</para>

<programlisting>
[orchestra setSerialSoundIn:YES];
</programlisting>

<para>To set up the <classname>MKOrchestra</classname> to do sound
output via the DSP serial port, you send it the message:</para>

<programlisting>
[orchestra setSerialSoundOut:YES];
</programlisting>

<para>You may simultaneously do serial port input and output.
Alternatively, you may combine serial port input with normal NeXT
sound output.</para>

<para>You may additionally provide an object that tells the MusicKit
about the kind of device you have connected to the DSP serial port.
To do this you send the message:</para>

<programlisting>
[orchestra setSerialPortDevice:aSerialPortDevice];
</programlisting>

<para>aSerialPortDevice must be an instance of the MusicKit class
DSPSerialPortDevice or one of its subclasses.  The class
DSPSerialPortDevice itself provides a general-purpose interface to a
number of common devices.  It supports
<productname>DigitalEars</productname>, the <productname>Ariel Digital
Microphone</productname>, <productname>DatPort</productname> and
<productname>ProPort</productname>.  However, some devices have
special requirements and features.  The Stealth DAI2400 is supported
by the StealthDAI2400 class, which is a subclass of
DSPSerialPortDevice; similarly, the Singular Solutions AD64x is
supported by the SSAD64x class.  You must use these subclasses when
using these devices.  The devices are not compatible with the generic
interface provided by DSPSerialPortDevice.  For example, to use the
<productname>AD64x</productname>:</para>

<title>The MusicKit <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> Subclasses</title>

<para>The MusicKit provides a number of

can use in your application.  <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>
objects are &ldquo;data-driven&rdquo;; during a performance, they're

<sect2 id="Pluck">
<title>Pluck</title>

<para>Pluck employs physical modelling to synthesize the sound of a
plucked string, using a technique developed by Alex Strong, Kevin
Karplus, David Jaffe and Julius Smith.  The real-world mechanics of a
plectrum plucking a string are replaced on the DSP by a burst of noise
filling a length of delay memory.  The delay memory is looped and
filtered, causing the initial noise burst to gradually become more
harmonic as the spectral energy subsides towards the fundamental,
emulating the strike-and-fade characteristics of a real plucked
string.</para>

<sect2 id="WavetableSynthesis">
<title>Wavetable Synthesis</title>

<para>Wavetable synthesis is a technique in which a length of memory
is filled with one or more periods of a waveform; the memory is then
looped during playback to produce a continuous signal.  While
wavetable synthesis is extremely easy to use&horbar;no messy formulas
are needed to create a musical timbre&horbar;it's somewhat limited to
the extent that you don't have control over the individual elements
that create the timbre (which you do with techniques such as frequency
modulation).</para>

<sect2 id="FrequencyModulation">
<title>Frequency Modulation</title>

<para>In frequency modulation (FM) synthesis, the output of one
oscillator controls the frequency of another oscillator.  If the
frequency of the controlling oscillator (or &ldquo;modulator&rdquo;)
is subaudio, the tone produced by the controlled oscillator (or
&ldquo;carrier&rdquo;) will exhibit vibrato.  However, as the
modulator's frequency is increased, the carrier's vibrato also
increases until the individual undulation become indistinguishable and
sidebands, or reflections of the modulator's frequency around the
carrier's frequency, appear.  If the oscillators are producing sine
waves with identical or harmonically-related frequencies, the
sidebands produce a harmonic series.  As the oscillators' waveforms
become more complex, the sidebands become more numerous, but they may
still produce a harmonic series.  However, if the oscillators'
frequencies aren't harmonically related, the result can be a
clangorous mess (which is good if you're trying to make bell sounds,
one of the more popular and occasionally unavoidable results of FM
synthesis).</para>

<sect1 id="BuildingAMKSynthPatch">
<title>Building a <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname></title>

<para>The <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> class is abstract; each
subclass of <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> describes a unique
strategy for creating a musical sound.  It does this by implementing
methods that provide two things:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>A <emphasis>patch</emphasis> specification.  A patch is a configuration of DSP synthesis/processing elements.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>A scheme for playing the patch.  This consists of
defining the conditions in which the patch is turned on and off and
how <classname>MKNote</classname> parameters are used to control it
while it's running.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Designing a patch is actually quite simple: The MusicKit
provides an object-oriented interface to the DSP, thus protecting the
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> designer from the rigors of
programming directly in DSP56000 assembly code.  While concern for
efficiency makes some knowledge of DSP memory organization necessary,
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> design makes greater demands of
your imagination in creating new sound-making schemes than of your
ability to examine and grasp the small print of signal
processing.</para>

<para>The MusicKit defines a number of conventions for controlling a
patch.  Most of these conventions are manifested as methods that are
declared as subclass responsibilities by the
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> class.  Other conventions are
given as general guidelines that should be followed to maintain
consistency with the <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> subclasses
provided by the MusicKit.</para>

<sect2 id="ASimpleMKSynthPatch">
<title>A Simple <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname></title>

<para>This section describes, by example, the basic steps for creating
a <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> subclass.  The example
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> produces a single sine wave (with
a settable frequency, amplitude, and bearing) for each
<classname>MKNote</classname> it receives.  The design is broken into
two parts: designing the patch specification, and playing the patch.
While the methodology shown for playing the patch introduces a number
of <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> design conventions, it lacks
some important features that enhance musical flexibility.  These
features are shown in the more complex
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> design demonstrated in

vibrato and a wide variety of parameters settable at any time, to a
simple <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> designed for applications
that assume traditional computer music scorefile semantics (such as
are assumed by MUSIC-5, CMUSIC, CSOUND, etc.).  Much of the complexity

<para>After creating the <classname>MKPatchTemplate</classname> instance (step 1 in the
example), synthElement specifications are added to it (step 2) using
methods defined by the <classname>MKPatchTemplate</classname> class.  There are three basic
methods to do this (a fourth method will be discussed later):</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>addUnitGenerator:</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>addSynthData:length:</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>addPatchpoint:</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Each of these methods returns an integer value that's used as an
index to the added synthElement.  Subsequent references to the
synthElements are always made through these indices.  Since all
instances of a particular <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> subclass
use the same set of indices, the variables that store the values
returned by these methods must be declared statically and be made
global to the entire class.</para>

<para>Finally, instructions for connecting the synthElements are
specified by invoking <classname>MKPatchTemplate</classname>'s <emphasis
role="bold">to:sel:arg:</emphasis> method (step 3).  The arguments to
this method are the receiver, selector, and argument, respectively, of
a message that will be sent when a <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>
instance is created.  Simplicity specifies a single connection:</para>

<programlisting>
[theTemplate to:osc sel:@selector(setOutput:) arg:outPatchpoint]
</programlisting>

<para>When an instance of Simplicity is created and played, the output
of the <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname> indexed by <emphasis
role="bold">osc</emphasis> will be set to the
<classname>MKSynthData</classname> indexed by <emphasis
role="bold">outPatchpoint</emphasis>.</para>

<sect4 id="SimplicitysSynthElementsExamined">
<title>Simplicity's SynthElements Examined</title>

<para>To understand the synthElements used in the example, you need to
be familiar with a simple detail of DSP memory organization.  DSP
memory is divided into three sections, x, y, and p.  x and y memory
are used for data; p memory is used for program code.  Thus,
<classname>MKSynthData</classname> objects represent data in either x
or y memory, while <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>s represent
DSP functions that always reside in p memory.  This is illustrated in
<xref linkend="DSPMemoryDivision">.</para>

</figure>

<para>The MusicKit further divides DSP memory into logical segments,
represented as integer constants.  In designing a
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>, you only need to be concerned
with four of these segments:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">MK_xPatch</emphasis> is used for
patchpoints in x memory.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">MK_yPatch</emphasis> is for
patchpoints in y memory.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">MK_xData</emphasis> is for
non-patchpoint <classname>MKSynthData</classname> objects in x
memory.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">MK_yData</emphasis> is for
non-patchpoint <classname>MKSynthData</classname> objects in y
memory.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>A <classname>MKSynthData</classname> object is specified by its
segment.  For example, Simplicity's patch contains a single
<classname>MKSynthData</classname> (a patchpoint) that resides in x
memory, as set in the message</para>

<programlisting>
/* Add an x segment patchpoint. */
[theTemplate addPatchpoint:MK_xPatch]
</programlisting>

<para><classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>s also refer to x and y
memory in order to properly read and write data.  Recall the first
<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname> added to Simplicity's
patch:</para>

<programlisting>
[theTemplate addUnitGenerator:[OscgUGxy class]]
</programlisting>

<para>The &ldquo;x&rdquo; and &ldquo;y&rdquo; in the class name
OscgUGxy refer to x and y memory spaces, respectively.  OscgUGxy is a
simple <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname> that has a single input
for reading data and a single output for writing data.  The order of
these data spigots, or <emphasis>memory arguments</emphasis>, is given
in the <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname> name as output followed
by input.  Thus, OscgUGxy's writes data to x memory (output) and reads
it from y memory (input).  The MusicKit provides a class for each
memory permutation: OscgUGyy, OscgUGyx, OscgUGxy, and OscgUGxx.  These
are called <emphasis>leaf classes</emphasis> of the <emphasis>master
class</emphasis> OscgUG.  Aside from the differing memory references,
the leaf classes are exactly the same.  Every
<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname> function provided by the
MusicKit is similarly organized into a master class and a complete set
of leaf classes.</para>

<tip><para>When describing a
subclass of <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>, it's convenient to
refer to the master class rather than a specific leaf class.
Furthermore, the &ldquo;UG&rdquo; (which stands for
&ldquo;<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>&rdquo;) is often dropped
from the master class name.</para></tip>

<para>The Oscg family of <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>s
provides a general oscillator function (the &ldquo;g&rdquo; in Oscg
stands for &ldquo;general&rdquo;).  An oscillator is a module that
creates a signal by cycling over a table of values, called a
<emphasis>lookup table</emphasis>, that represents a single period of
a waveform.  In a general oscillator, the lookup table isn't part of
the <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>.  You can supply the
oscillator with a lookup table by using a
<classname>MKWaveTable</classname> object (this will be demonstrated
in a subsequent example).  Alternatively, the oscillator can use the
built-in sineROM, a read-only section of y memory that contains a
single period of a sine wave.  Simplicity's OscgUGxy does the latter:
It reads the sineRom, therefore its input <emphasis>must</emphasis>
read from y memory.  In the example, the connection between the
sineROM and OscgUGxy is made by default&horbar;it needn't be specified
through the <emphasis role="bold">to:sel:arg:</emphasis>
method.</para>

<para>One of the conventions of designing a patch is to balance, as
much as possible, the use of x and y memory.  Since Simplicity's
oscillator must read from y memory in order to read the sineROM, its
output is set to x memory.  So of the four Oscg leaf classes, OscgUGxy
is chosen.</para>

<para>The other <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname> in Simplicity's
patch, Out2sumUGx, is a special <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>
that adds a stream of (two-channel) sample data to the stereo output
sample stream.  The single memory argument (the &ldquo;x&rdquo; in
Out2sumUGx) is the <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>'s input.
Simplicity uses the Out2sumUGx leaf class so the
<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname> can read the MK_xPatch
patchpoint that's written to by OscgUGxy.  <xref

<para>Notice that <xref linkend="SimplicitysPatch"> shows a connection
between the patchpoint and the input of Out2Sum, a connection that

connection to the output <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname> is

<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> receives a noteOn.  This method,
called <emphasis role="bold">noteOnSelf:</emphasis>, is examined in
the next section.</para>

<para>Keep in mind that a <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> object
is ordinarily created and controlled by an instance of
<classname>MKSynthInstrument</classname>.  During a MusicKit
performance, the <classname>MKSynthInstrument</classname> distributes
the Notes it receives to the various
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> objects that it controls through
the methods <emphasis role="bold">noteOn:</emphasis>, <emphasis
role="bold">noteUpdate:</emphasis>, and <emphasis
role="bold">noteOff:</emphasis> (the
<classname>MKSynthInstrument</classname> treats a noteDur as a noteOn
and manufactures a noteOff to balance it; also, the
<classname>MKSynthInstrument</classname> normally suppresses mutes).
The design of a <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> subclass must
include a methodology to control the patch in response to these
messages.  This is done by implementing the following methods:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>noteOnSelf:</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>noteUpdateSelf:</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>noteOffSelf:</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>noteEndSelf</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>As their names imply, the first three of these methods are
invoked automatically when the <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>
receives a <emphasis role="bold">noteOn:</emphasis>, <emphasis
role="bold">noteUpdate:</emphasis>, or <emphasis
role="bold">noteOff:</emphasis> message, respectively.  <emphasis
role="bold">noteEndSelf</emphasis> is automatically invoked when the
<classname>MKNote</classname> is completely finished and is provided
to accommodate the release portion of the
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>'s
<classname>MKEnvelope</classname>s.</para>

<tip><para>While these four methods
aren't subclass responsibilities, the default implementations provided
by the <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> class do nothing.  Thus, if
you don't provide an implementation of, for example, <emphasis
role="bold">noteUpdateSelf:</emphasis>, your
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> won't respond to
noteUpdates.</para></tip>

<sect4 id="TheNoteOnSelfMethod">
<title>The noteOnSelf: Method</title>

<para>Simplicity, our example <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>,
implements <emphasis role="bold">noteOnSelf:</emphasis> as
follows:</para>

<programlisting>
- noteOnSelf:aNote
{
    /* Step 1: Read the parameters in the Note and apply them to the patch. */ 
    [self applyParameters:aNote];
    /*
     * Step 2: Turn on the patch by connecting the Out2sumUGx object 
     * to the patchpoint and sending the run message to all the 
     * synthElements.
     */
    [[self synthElementAt: stereoOut]
                 setInput: [self synthElementAt:outPatchpoint]];
    [synthElements makeObjectsPerform:@selector(run)];
    return self;
}
</programlisting>

<para>The first of the two steps, applying the
<classname>MKNote</classname> parameters to the patch, is performed in
the <emphasis role="bold">applyParameters:</emphasis> method.  The
implementation of this method is described in a later section.</para>

<para>The second step, turning on the patch, distinguishes the
<emphasis role="bold">noteOnSelf:</emphasis> method from the others.
The first message in step 2 sets the input of <emphasis
role="bold">stereoOut</emphasis> (the Out2Sum
<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>) to the patchpoint <emphasis
role="bold">outPatchpoint</emphasis> (recall that this connection was
purposely left unspecified in the <classname>MKPatchTemplate</classname>).  The final message
sends <emphasis role="bold">run</emphasis> to each of the
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>'s synthElements.  This causes the
<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>s to begin operating.</para>

<tip><para>While it isn't necessary
to send <emphasis role="bold">run</emphasis> to the patch's
patchpoint, it's convenient to send it to all synthElements as shown
in the example.  <classname>MKSynthData</classname> implements
<emphasis role="bold">run</emphasis> to do nothing, so there's no harm
in sending this message to a patchpoint.</para></tip>

<para>The extremely important step of actually creating and connecting
the objects that make up Simplicity's patch is performed
automatically.  As described in the next chapter, part of a
<classname>MKSynthInstrument</classname>'s duties when it receives a
<classname>MKNote</classname> is to allocate an appropriate
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> object to synthesize the
<classname>MKNote</classname>.  It does this by sending <emphasis
role="bold">patchTemplateFor:</emphasis> to its
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> subclass with the received
<classname>MKNote</classname> as the argument.  As we have seen, this
method returns a <classname>MKPatchTemplate</classname> object.  It then allocates a
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> according to the specifications in
the <classname>MKPatchTemplate</classname> and forwards the <classname>MKNote</classname> to
the <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> through the <emphasis
role="bold">noteOn:</emphasis> method.  Thus, by the time the
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> receives the <emphasis
role="bold">noteOnSelf:</emphasis> message (which is sent by <emphasis
role="bold">noteOn:</emphasis>) the patch has already been
created.</para>

<para>A <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> contains a
<classname>NSArray</classname> of the objects that make up its patch
in its <emphasis role="bold">synthElements</emphasis> instance
variable.  In the example above, a use of this instance variable is
given as the receiver of the message that causes the
<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>s to start running:</para>

<programlisting>
[synthElements makeObjectsPerform: @selector(run)];
</programlisting>

<para>You can retrieve a particular object from the <emphasis
role="bold">synthElements</emphasis> <classname>NSArray</classname> by
invoking the <emphasis role="bold">synthElementAt:</emphasis> method,
passing the index of the synthElement as the argument.  This is
demonstrated in the example above in the line</para>

<programlisting>
[[self synthElementAt:stereoOut] setInput:[self synthElementAt:outPatchpoint]];
</programlisting>

<para><emphasis role="bold">synthElementAt:stereoOut</emphasis>
returns an instance of the object indexed by <emphasis
role="bold">stereoOut</emphasis>.  In other words, it returns an
instance of the Out2sumUGx class, as specified in Simplicity's
<emphasis role="bold">patchTemplateFor:</emphasis> method.  Similarly,
<emphasis role="bold">synthElementAt:outPatchpoint</emphasis> returns
Simplicity's patchpoint.</para>

<para>Finally, the return value of <emphasis
role="bold">noteOnSelf:</emphasis> is significant: If the method
returns <emphasis role="bold">nil</emphasis>, the argument
<classname>MKNote</classname> isn't synthesized.  Simplicity's
implementation always returns <emphasis role="bold">self</emphasis> so
all noteOns that it receives are synthesized.</para>
</sect4>
<sect4 id="TheNoteUpdateSelfMethod">
<title>The noteUpdateSelf: Method</title>

<para>Simplicity's implementation of <emphasis
role="bold">noteUpdateSelf:</emphasis> is straightforward; it simply
applies its argument's parameters to the patch:</para>

<programlisting>
- noteUpdateSelf:aNote
{
    [self applyParameters:aNote];
    return self;
}
</programlisting>

<para>The value returned by <emphasis
role="bold">noteUpdateSelf:</emphasis> is ignored.</para>
</sect4>
<sect4 id="TheNoteOffSelfAndNoteEndSelfMethods">
<title>The noteOffSelf: and noteEndSelf Methods</title>

<para>The methods <emphasis role="bold">noteOffSelf:</emphasis> and
<emphasis role="bold">noteEndSelf</emphasis> work together to wind
down and deactivate a <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>.  As
mentioned earlier, <emphasis role="bold">noteOffSelf:</emphasis> is
automatically sent when a noteOff is forwarded to the
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> through the <emphasis
role="bold">noteOff:</emphasis> method.  When a noteOff arrives, the
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> doesn't stop; rather, the noteOff
is taken as a signal to begin the release portions of any
<classname>MKEnvelope</classname>s that are part of the patch.  The
value returned by <emphasis role="bold">noteOffSelf:</emphasis> is
taken as the amount of time, in seconds, to wait before invoking
<emphasis role="bold">noteEnd</emphasis>; this value is usually the
release time of the <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>'s amplitude
envelope.  Since Simplicity doesn't have any
<classname>MKEnvelope</classname>s, its implementation of <emphasis
role="bold">noteOffSelf:</emphasis> always returns 0.0 (an example of
a <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> that uses
<classname>MKEnvelope</classname>s is given later):</para>

<programlisting>
- (double)noteOffSelf:aNote
{
    [self applyParameters:aNote];
    /* No Envelopes, so no release time is needed. */
    return 0.0;
}
</programlisting>

<para>Even though a noteOff is the beginning of the end of a
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>'s activity, the
<classname>MKNote</classname> may contain some parameters; these
parameters are applied just as in the other methods, by invoking
<emphasis role="bold">applyParameters:</emphasis>.</para>

<para>After waiting the prescribed amount of time, the <emphasis
role="bold">noteEnd</emphasis> message is sent.  <emphasis
role="bold">noteEnd</emphasis> invokes <emphasis
role="bold">noteEndSelf</emphasis>, a method that deactivates the
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>:</para>

<programlisting>
- noteEndSelf
{
    /* Deactivate the SynthPatch by idling the output. */
    [[self synthElementAt:stereoOut] idle];
    return self;
}
</programlisting>

<para>The <emphasis role="bold">idle</emphasis> method is implemented
by all subclasses of <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>.  In its
implementation of <emphasis role="bold">idle</emphasis>, Out2sum
connects its input to a predefined patchpoint that always contains
zero data (the data in the patchpoint consists wholly of zeroes).
This effectively turns off the patch.  Notice that the
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> isn't freed, nor is its patch (as
specified in the <classname>MKPatchTemplate</classname>) dismantled.  An important convention
of <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> design is to perform the
minimum amount of work necessary when deactivating the object.  This
makes both the deactivation itself and a subsequent reactivation (when
another noteOn arrives) as efficient as possible.</para>

<para>It should be noted that <emphasis role="bold">noteEnd</emphasis>
(and, thus, <emphasis role="bold">noteEndSelf</emphasis>) is also
invoked when the <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> is created,
thereby ensuring that the patch is silent until the first
<classname>MKNote</classname> is received.  This also explains why the
final connection to Out2sum isn't specified in the
<classname>MKPatchTemplate</classname>&horbar;if it was so specified, the connection would be
made only to be immediately severed upon reception of the <emphasis
role="bold">noteEnd</emphasis> message (the patch is created before
<emphasis role="bold">noteEnd</emphasis> is sent).</para>
</sect4>
<sect4 id="ApplyingParameters">
<title>Applying Parameters</title>

<para>The final step in our <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> design
is to supply it with parameter values.  As mentioned earlier,
Simplicity has three settable attributes: frequency, amplitude, and
bearing.  Simplicity implements the method <emphasis
role="bold">applyParameters:</emphasis> to read the appropriate
parameters from its argument <classname>MKNote</classname> and apply
their values to the patch:</para>

<programlisting>
- applyParameters:aNote
{
    /* Retrieve and store the parameters. */
    double  myFreq = [aNote freq];
    double  myAmp = [aNote parAsDouble:MK_amp];
    double  myBearing = [aNote parAsDouble:MK_bearing];
    /* Apply frequency if present. */
    if ( !MKIsNoDVal(myFreq) )
        [[self synthElementAt:osc] setFreq:myFreq];
    /* Apply amplitude if present. */
    if ( !MKIsNoDVal(myAmp) )
        [[self synthElementAt:osc] setAmp:myAmp];
    /* Apply bearing if present. */
    if ( !MKIsNoDVal(myBearing) )
        [[self synthElementAt:stereoOut] setBearing:myBearing];
}
</programlisting>

<para>First, the parameters are retrieved from the argument
<classname>MKNote</classname>.  Notice that the <emphasis
role="bold">freq</emphasis> method is used to retrieve frequency;
recall from the description of the <classname>MKNote</classname> class
that this method returns the value of <emphasis
role="bold">MK_freq</emphasis> or, in <emphasis
role="bold">MK_freq</emphasis>'s absence, a value converted from
<emphasis role="bold">MK_keyNum</emphasis>.</para>

<para>To apply a parameter value to the patch, you send a message to
the <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname> that controls that aspect
of the patch.  The Oscg <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>
controls frequency and amplitude, so <emphasis
role="bold">setFreq:</emphasis> and <emphasis
role="bold">setAmp:</emphasis> are sent to the patch's OscgUGxy
object.  Out2sum controls bearing, so it receives <emphasis
role="bold">setBearing:</emphasis>.  These methods are defined in the
<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>s' master classes.</para>

added to both frequency and amplitude.  The patch specification is
accordingly more complex than in Simplicity.  In addition, a number of

the <classname>MKPatchTemplate</classname>, and the connections between SynthElements are
specified.  However, two new <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>
families, Oscgafi and Asymp, are introduced.  These are examined in
the next sections; briefly, Oscgafi is a general oscillator that
allows another <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname> to its amplitude
and frequency.  Asymp is an envelope handler; it's used to apply
<classname>MKEnvelope</classname> objects to the patch.  Asympenv is a
variant of Asymp that is better-suited to interactive real-time
applications. The patch is illustrated in <xref linkend="EnvysPatch">.</para>

<para>Returning to the code example, notice that <emphasis
role="bold">ampPp</emphasis> and <emphasis
role="bold">outPp</emphasis> are given the same value:</para>

<programlisting>
ampPp = [theTemplate addPatchpoint:MK_xPatch];
. . .
outPp = ampPp;
</programlisting>

<para>When the patch is created, these two synthElement indices will
refer to the same object.  In other words, the patchpoint that's used
in the connection between <emphasis role="bold">ampAsymp</emphasis>
and <emphasis role="bold">osc</emphasis> is reused in the connection
between <emphasis role="bold">osc</emphasis> and <emphasis
role="bold">stereoOut</emphasis>.  Reusing patchpoints makes the patch
smaller and more efficient.  However, you can only reuse patchpoints
if the patch's <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>s are executed in
a predictable order.  Consider how Envy's
<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>s use the shared
patchpoint:</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis role="bold">ampAsymp</emphasis> writes to <emphasis role="bold">ampPp</emphasis>.</para>  
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis role="bold">osc</emphasis> reads from <emphasis role="bold">ampPp</emphasis> and writes to <emphasis role="bold">outPp</emphasis>.</para>  
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis role="bold">stereoOut</emphasis> reads from <emphasis role="bold">outPp</emphasis>.</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>For the shared patchpoint scheme to work, the
<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>s must be executed in the order
given&horbar;chaos would reign should <emphasis
role="bold">stereoOut</emphasis> read from <emphasis
role="bold">outPp</emphasis> before <emphasis
role="bold">osc</emphasis> writes to it.  The order in which a
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>'s
<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>s are executed is the order in
which their specifications are added to the
<classname>MKPatchTemplate</classname>.  Thus, Envy's
<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>s are executed in the following
order:</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>ampAsymp</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>freqAsymp</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>osc</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>stereoOut</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>Since <emphasis role="bold">ampAsymp</emphasis> is executed
before <emphasis role="bold">osc</emphasis>, and <emphasis
role="bold">osc</emphasis> before <emphasis
role="bold">stereoOut</emphasis>, the patchpoint between <emphasis
role="bold">ampAsymp</emphasis> and <emphasis
role="bold">osc</emphasis> can be reused as the patchpoint between
<emphasis role="bold">osc</emphasis> and <emphasis
role="bold">stereoOut</emphasis>.</para>

<tip><para>For some patches, the
order in which the <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>s are
executed doesn't matter.  You can add
<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>s and declare their execution to
be unordered by using the <emphasis
role="bold">addUnitGenerator:ordered:</emphasis> method, passing NO as
the second argument (the <emphasis
role="bold">addUnitGenerator:</emphasis> is actually a shorthand; it
invokes <emphasis role="bold">addUnitGenerator:ordered:</emphasis>
with YES as the second argument).  While you can't share patchpoints
in a patch that uses unordered
<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>s, allocating the patch is
somewhat more efficient.</para></tip>

<sect4 id="Oscgafi">
<title>Oscgafi</title>

<para>The Oscgafi <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname> is the most
flexible oscillator provided by the MusicKit.  In addition to allowing
envelope control of amplitude and frequency, it also performs an
interpolation, minimizing the noise that's sometimes introduced when
reading the lookup table.  The components of the
<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>'s name summarize these
features:</para>

<para><emphasis role="bold">Component	Meaning</emphasis></para> 

<para>Osc	Oscillator</para>

<para>g	General</para>

<para>a	Amplitude control</para>

<para>f	Frequency control</para> 

<para>i	Interpolation</para>

<para>Oscgafi has four memory arguments, in this order:</para>

<para>1.	output</para> 

<para>2.	amplitude control input</para> 

<para>3.	frequency control input</para> 

<para>4.	lookup table input</para>

<para>The permutations of a <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>
with four memory arguments results in 16 leaf classes.  Envy uses the
xxyy version (OscgafiUGxxyy), so the memory arguments correspond to
memory space as follows:</para>

<para><emphasis role="bold">Argument	Space</emphasis></para> 

<para>output	x</para>

<para>amplitude control	x</para> 

<para>frequency control	y</para> 

<para>lookup table	y</para>

<para>A notable difference between Oscg and Oscgafi is that in the
latter, frequency and amplitude aren't set directly through messages
to the oscillator.  To control these attributes, you affect the
<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>s that are connected to
Oscgafi's inputs.  The MusicKit provides a C function, called
<emphasis role="bold">MKUpdateAsymp()</emphasis> that does this for
you.  This function is described later as it's used to apply parameter
values to Envy's patch.</para>

<para>In addition, Oscgafi's frequency input is actually an increment
input&horbar;the oscillator's frequency is defined by the increment,
or step size, that it uses when reading its lookup table.  This
explains why <emphasis role="bold">osc</emphasis> is connected to the
<emphasis role="bold">freqPp</emphasis> patchpoint through the
<emphasis role="bold">setIncInput:</emphasis> method:</para>

<programlisting>
[theTemplate to:osc sel:@selector(setIncInput:) arg:freqPp];
</programlisting>

<para>Oscgafi's <emphasis role="bold">incAtFreq:</emphasis> method is
provided to translate frequencies into increments.  This, too, will be
used when applying parameter values.</para>
</sect4>

<sect4 id="AsympAndAsympenv">
<title>Asymp and Asympenv</title>

<para>The Asymp and Asympenv <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>s
are envelope handlers; they translates the data in an
<classname>MKEnvelope</classname> object and load it onto the DSP.  An
<classname>MKEnvelope</classname> object is associated with an Asymp
or Asympenv through the <emphasis
role="bold">MKUpdateAsymp()</emphasis> function. The only difference
between Asymp and Asympenv is that the former allows for arbitrarily
long envelopes and the latter is better-suited to interactive
real-time applications.</para>

<para>Envy uses two Asympenvs, one to control the frequency of Oscgafi
and the other to control its amplitude.  The leaf classes are chosen
to match the memory arguments in Oscgafi: The Asympenv leaf class that
controls amplitude is AsympenvUGx; for frequency, it's
AsympenvUGy.</para>

<sect3 id="PlayingThePatch2">
<title>Playing the Patch</title>

<para>A number of new conventions for playing and controlling a
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> are introduced in the following
sections.  In particular, the conventions regarding preemption,
rearticulation, and &ldquo;sticky&rdquo; parameters are
demonstrated.</para>

<sect4 id="DeclaringTheParameters">
<title>Declaring the Parameters</title>

<para>A convention of <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> design (one
that wasn't followed in the implementation of Simplicity) is to create
an instance variable for each parameter the
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> responds to.  The variables are
used to maintain the state of the object's patch.</para>

<para>Because of the introduction of envelope control into the patch,
Envy responds to several more parameters than did Simplicity.  These
are shown as they are declared as instance variables in the
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>'s interface file (
<filename class=headerfile>Envy.h</filename>):</para>

<programlisting>
@interface Envy:SynthPatch
{
    /* Amplitude parameters. */
    id      ampEnv;         /* the Envelope object for amplitude */
    double  amp1,           /* amplitude at y=1 */
            amp0,           /* amplitude at y=0 */
            ampAtt,         /* ampEnv attack duration in seconds */
            ampRel;         /* ampEnv release duration in seconds*/
    /* Frequency parameters. */ 
    id      freqEnv;        /* the Envelope object for frequency */
    double  freq1,          /* frequency at y=1 */
            freq0,          /* frequency at y=0 */
            freqAtt,        /* freqEnv attack duration in seconds*/
            freqRel;        /* freqEnv release duration in seconds */
    /* Other parameters. */
    double  portamento;     /* transition time in seconds */ 
    double  bearing;        /* stereo location */
}
</programlisting>

<para>A set of defaults for the parameter instance variables should
also be included in a <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> design.
Envy implements a method called <emphasis
role="bold">setDefaults</emphasis> to provide this:</para>

<programlisting>
- setDefaults
{
    ampEnv     = nil;
    amp0       = 0.0;
    amp1       = MK_DEFAULTAMP;         /* 0.1 */
    ampAtt     = MK_NODVAL;             /* parameter not present */
    ampRel     = MK_NODVAL;             /* parameter not present */
    freqEnv    = nil;
    freq0      = 0.0;
    freq1      = MK_DEFAULTFREQ;        /* 440.0 */
    freqAtt    = MK_NODVAL;             /* parameter not present */
    freqRel    = MK_NODVAL;             /* parameter not present */
    portamento = MK_DEFAULTPORTAMENTO;  /* 0.1 */
    bearing    = MK_DEFAULTBEARING;     /* 0.0 (center) */
    return self;
}
</programlisting>

<para>By convention, a <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>'s parameter
instance variables should be set to their default values before the
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> begins a new phrase.  This is done
by invoking <emphasis role="bold">setDefaults</emphasis> from the
<emphasis role="bold">noteEndSelf</emphasis> method.  Keep in mind
that <emphasis role="bold">noteEnd</emphasis>, which invokes <emphasis
role="bold">noteEndSelf</emphasis>, is invoked when a new
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> is created, so <emphasis
role="bold">setDefaults:</emphasis> will be invoked before the first
<classname>MKNote</classname> arrives as well as after the end of each
phrase.</para>

<para>However, one other condition must be considered&horbar;that of
the preempted <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>&horbar;which, by
definition, isn't sent the <emphasis role="bold">noteEnd</emphasis>
message.  The <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> class defines a
method <emphasis role="bold">preemptFor:</emphasis> that you can
redefine in your subclass to reset the parameter instance variables to
their default values and to provide any other special behavior for a
preempted <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>.  The method is invoked
just before the <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> receives, in a
<emphasis role="bold">noteOn:</emphasis> message, the
<classname>MKNote</classname> for which it was preempted (the argument
to <emphasis role="bold">preemptFor:</emphasis> is this same
<classname>MKNote</classname>).  Envy implements <emphasis
role="bold">preemptFor:</emphasis> to preempt the amplitude
<classname>MKEnvelope</classname> and invoke <emphasis
role="bold">setDefaults:</emphasis>.  It ignores the argument:</para>

<programlisting>
- preemptFor:aNote
{
    [[self synthElementAt:ampAsymp] preemptEnvelope];
    [self setDefaults];
    return self;
}
</programlisting>
</sect4>
<sect4 id="TheNoteOnSelfAndNoteUpdateSelfMethods">
<title>The noteOnSelf: and noteUpdateSelf: Methods</title>

<para>These two methods follow the same form as those in Simplicity:</para>

<programlisting>
- noteOnSelf:aNote
{
    /* Apply the parameters to the patch. */
    [self applyParameters:aNote];
    /* Make the final connection to the output sample stream.*/
    [[self synthElementAt:stereoOut] setInput:outPp];
    /* Tell the UnitGenerators to begin running. */
    [synthElements makeObjectsPerform:@selector(run)];
    return self;
}
- noteUpdateSelf:aNote
{
    /* Apply the parameters to the patch. */
    [self applyParameters:aNote];
    return self;
}
</programlisting>

<para>Once again, both methods invoke <emphasis
role="bold">applyParameters:</emphasis> to apply the Note's parameters
to the patch.  In addition, <emphasis
role="bold">noteOnSelf:</emphasis> completes the connection between
Oscgafi and Out2sum, and it tells the
<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>s to run by sending <emphasis
role="bold">run</emphasis> to each of the synthElements.</para>
</sect4>
<sect4 id="TheNoteOffSelfAndNoteEndSelfMethods2">
<title>The noteOffSelf: and noteEndSelf Methods</title>

<para>Recall that the value returned by <emphasis
role="bold">noteOffSelf:</emphasis> is taken as the amount of time to
wait (in seconds) before <emphasis role="bold">noteEnd</emphasis> is
invoked.  Typically, this value is the release time of the
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>'s amplitude
<classname>MKEnvelope</classname>:</para>

<programlisting>
- (double)noteOffSelf:aNote
{
    /* Apply the parameters. */
    [self applyParameters: aNote];
    /* Signal the release portion of the frequency Envelope. */
    [[self synthElementAt:freqAsymp] finish];
    /* Same for amplitude, but also return the release duration. */
    return [[self synthElementAt:ampAsymp] finish];
}
</programlisting>

<para>An Asympenv responds to the <emphasis
role="bold">finish</emphasis> message by signaling the release portion
of its <classname>MKEnvelope</classname>; the method returns the
duration of the release.</para>

<para>As in Simplicity, <emphasis role="bold">noteEndSelf</emphasis>
sends <emphasis role="bold">idle</emphasis> to the Out2sum object to
remove it from the output sample stream.  It also aborts the frequency
<classname>MKEnvelope</classname> (we're assured that the amplitude
<classname>MKEnvelope</classname> has finished since its demise is
what causes this method to be invoked) and then invokes the <emphasis
role="bold">setDefaults</emphasis> method, as dictated in <xref

</sect4>
<sect4 id="PhraseStatus">
<title>Phrase Status</title>

<para>The manner in which a <classname>MKNote</classname>'s parameters
are applied to a patch can depend on the performance context in which
the <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> receives the
<classname>MKNote</classname>.  This context, called <emphasis>phrase
status</emphasis>, is represented as an MKPhraseStatus constant and is
automatically set when the <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>
receives a phrase event message (such as <emphasis
role="bold">noteOn:</emphasis> and <emphasis
role="bold">noteUpdate:</emphasis>).  There are seven phrase
states:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">MK_phraseOn</emphasis> means
that the received <classname>MKNote</classname> is a noteOn and the
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> has been freshly allocated to
synthesize the <classname>MKNote</classname>.  This status indicates
the beginning of a new phrase.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">MK_phraseRearticulate</emphasis>
indicates a noteOn that rearticulates an existing phrase.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">MK_phraseOnPreempt</emphasis> is
also used for noteOns, but it indicates that the
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> has been preempted to synthesize
the <classname>MKNote</classname>.  Like <emphasis
role="bold">MK_phraseOn</emphasis>, this status means that a new
phrase is beginning.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">MK_phraseUpdate</emphasis> means
that the <classname>MKNote</classname> is a noteUpdate and the
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> is in the attack or stickpoint
portions of its <classname>MKEnvelope</classname>s (the
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>'s synthStatus is <emphasis
role="bold">MK_running</emphasis>).</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">MK_phraseOff</emphasis>
indicates a noteOff.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">MK_phraseOffUpdate</emphasis> is
for a noteUpdate that arrives during the release portion of the
<classname>MKEnvelope</classname>s (synthStatus is <emphasis
role="bold">MK_finishing</emphasis>).</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">MK_phraseEnd</emphasis> is used
to indicate the end of a phrase.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>A <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>'s phrase status, which is
retrieved by sending <emphasis role="bold">phraseStatus</emphasis> to
the <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>, is provided solely as a
convenience to <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> designers and is
only valid within the implementations of the <emphasis
role="bold">noteOnSelf:</emphasis>, <emphasis
role="bold">noteUpdateSelf:</emphasis>, <emphasis
role="bold">noteOffSelf:</emphasis>, and <emphasis
role="bold">noteEndSelf</emphasis> methods.  Sent to a
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> from outside these methods,
<emphasis role="bold">phraseStatus</emphasis> returns <emphasis
role="bold">MK_noPhraseActivity</emphasis>.</para>

<para>You can use phrase status in the design of your
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> in a test that leads to
specialized behavior.  For example, you may want to apply certain
noteUpdate parameters differently, depending on whether the phrase
status is <emphasis role="bold">MK_phraseUpdate</emphasis> or
<emphasis role="bold">MK_phraseOffUpdate</emphasis>.  Two conventional
uses of phrase status&horbar;as an argument to the <emphasis
role="bold">MKUpdateAsymp()</emphasis> function and to determine if a
<classname>MKNote</classname> is the beginning of a new
phrase&horbar;are demonstrated in the next section.</para>
</sect4>
<sect4 id="EnvyApplyingParameters">
<title>Applying Parameters</title>

<para>The way that Envy applies a <classname>MKNote</classname>'s
parameters is more sophisticated than the manner employed by
Simplicity.  A convention ignored in the design of Simplicity holds
that a noteOn that rearticulates a phrase should inherit, if
necessary, the values of the parameters in the phrase so far.  For
example, if a rearticulating noteOn doesn't contain an amplitude
<classname>MKEnvelope</classname>, it uses the one set in the previous
noteOn.  The implementation of Envy accommodates this by storing its
parameter values as instance variables: It can supply a
&ldquo;missing&rdquo; parameter by using the value stored in the
appropriate variable.</para>

<para>Determining the correct value for amplitude and frequency is
more complicated in the implementation of Envy than in that of
Simplicity.  Because of its use of <classname>MKEnvelope</classname>
objects, Envy's amplitude and frequency depend on the values of a
number of related parameters.  The MusicKit provides a C function
called <emphasis role="bold">MKUpdateAsymp()</emphasis> that helps to
untangle this web.  The function takes, as arguments, all the objects
and parameter values associated with a particular
<classname>MKEnvelope</classname> and applies them in a predictable
manner to the attribute that the <classname>MKEnvelope</classname>
controls.</para>

<para><emphasis role="bold">MKUpdateAsymp()</emphasis> takes eight
arguments:</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>An Asymp or Asympenv object</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>An <classname>MKEnvelope</classname> object</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The <classname>MKEnvelope</classname>'s value when y =

<listitem><para>The <classname>MKEnvelope</classname>'s value when y =
1.0</para></listitem>

time</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The portamento value (not currently supported for
Asympenv)</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The current phrase status</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>The function's behavior is described in <xref linkend=FunctionDescription>.
Briefly, it applies an <classname>MKEnvelope</classname> (argument 2)
to an Asymp or Asympenv (argument 1) after properly scaling the
<classname>MKEnvelope</classname>'s value range (arguments 3 and 4)
and setting its attack and release times (arguments 5 and 6).
Portamento (argument 7) is used only if the phrase status (argument 8)
is <emphasis role="bold">MK_phraseRearticulate</emphasis>.</para>

<para>Envy's implementation of the <emphasis

conventional way to apply parameters to a patch that includes

<para>As in Simplicity's implementation of <emphasis
role="bold">applyParameters:</emphasis>, the value of each parameter
is stored and then checked to determine whether the parameter is
actually present in the argument <classname>MKNote</classname>.  In
addition, this implementation updates the values of the instance
variables to those of the parameters that are present.</para>

<para>Each parameter that affects amplitude is checked in its own
conditional statement.  If the parameter is present, the <emphasis
role="bold">shouldApplyAmp</emphasis> variable is set to YES,
indicating that the amplitude <classname>MKEnvelope</classname> needs
to be updated.  Finally, the value of <emphasis
role="bold">shouldApplyAmp</emphasis> is logically or'd with the value
of <emphasis role="bold">isNoteOn</emphasis>, which is YES if
<emphasis role="bold">aNote</emphasis> is a noteOn.  Thus, the
<emphasis role="bold">MKUpdateAsymp()</emphasis> call for amplitude is
made if any of the tested parameters are present, and it's always made
if <emphasis role="bold">aNote</emphasis> is a noteOn.</para>

<para>The conditionals for applying the frequency parameters are the
same as those for amplitude.  Notice, however, that the <emphasis
role="bold">freq0</emphasis> and <emphasis
role="bold">freq1</emphasis> values aren't passed directly to
<emphasis role="bold">MKUpdateAsymp()</emphasis>.  Instead, they're
used to retrieve increment values from <emphasis
role="bold">osc</emphasis> through its <emphasis
role="bold">incAtFreq:</emphasis> method.  As mentioned earlier,
Oscgafi's frequency value isn't set as a frequency in hertz, but
rather as an increment into its lookup table.</para>

<para>Finally, the bearing parameter is tested, its instance variable
is set, and the parameter is applied to the patch.  Notice that
bearing is automatically applied if <emphasis
role="bold">aNote</emphasis> is the beginning of a new phrase.  Unlike
amplitude and frequency, bearing isn't controlled by an
<classname>MKEnvelope</classname>, so it doesn't need to be
automatically applied if the <classname>MKNote</classname> is simply a
rearticulation of an existing phrase.</para>

<sect2 id="AddingAMKWaveTable">
<title>Adding a <classname>MKWaveTable</classname></title>

<para>Envy, although otherwise entertaining, is of limited timbral
interest&horbar;it can only produce a sine wave.  Replacing Envy's
sine wave with a <classname>MKWaveTable</classname> is quite simple;
its patch isn't affected, nor are the implementations of the <emphasis
role="bold">noteOnSelf:</emphasis> type methods.  The only real change
is in the implementation of <emphasis
role="bold">applyParameters:</emphasis>.</para>

<para>First, however, you must provide an instance variable and
default value for <emphasis
role="bold">MK_waveform</emphasis>&horbar;the parameter that
identifies <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>'s
<classname>MKWaveTable</classname> object:</para>

<programlisting>
@interface Envy:SynthPatch
{
    id waveform;
    . . .
}

- setDefaults
{
    waveform = nil;
    . . .
}
</programlisting>

<para>The <emphasis role="bold">applyParameters:</emphasis> method is
rewritten to attend to the new parameter:</para>

<programlisting>
- applyParameters:aNote
{
    . . .
    /* Create local variables for the new parameter. */
    id  myWaveform = [aNote parAsWaveTable:MK_waveform];
    BOOL shouldApplyWave = NO;
    /* Test the parameters. */
    if (myWaveform != nil) {
        waveform = myWaveform;
        shouldApplyWave = YES; 
    }
    if (shouldApplyWave || isNewPhrase)
        [[self synthElementAt:osc] setTable: waveform
                                     length: 0
                           defaultToSineROM: isNewPhrase];
    . . .
}
</programlisting>

<para>The <emphasis
role="bold">setTable:length:defaultToSineROM:</emphasis> method sets
the oscillator's lookup table to the specified
<classname>MKWaveTable</classname> object.  Passing 0 as the length of
the table causes the MusicKit to compute a default value.  The
argument to <emphasis role="bold">defaultToSineROM:</emphasis> is a
BOOL value that determines whether the sineROM should be used if
memory for the <classname>MKWaveTable</classname> can't be allocated.
In this implementation, the argument is YES only if <emphasis
role="bold">aNote</emphasis> is the beginning of a new phrase.  For
all other phrase states, the previously set
<classname>MKWaveTable</classname> is used if a new one can't be
allocated.</para>

<para>WaveTables are shared among
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>es&horbar;if two
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>es declare the same
<classname>MKWaveTable</classname> object (with the same length), the
<classname>MKWaveTable</classname> is allocated once and the
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>es read from the same memory.  This
feature is provided automatically by all the Oscg-type
oscillators.</para>

<sect1 id="DoingReal-timeSoundProcessing">
<title>Doing Real-time Sound Processing</title>

<para>One of the most exciting aspects of the MusicKit is the ability
to process sound in real time, under arbitrarily rich control.  To do
this, you follow all the guidelines given above.  There are only three
differences:</para> 

  <orderedlist>

<listitem><para>You must connect hardware that accepts sound input to
the DSP serial port.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>You must set up the <classname>MKOrchesra</classname> to do sound processing.</para>
    </listitem>

<listitem><para>You must have an In1aUG or In1bUG in your <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>.</para>
     </listitem>
   </orderedlist>

<para>The standard NeXT configuration (at the time of this writing)
does not include a high-quality sound input.  Therefore, in order to
do real-time high-quality sound processing, you need to obtain a
device that plugs into the DSP serial port.  See <xref
linkend="UsingTheDSPSerialPort"> above for how to set up the hardware
and how to configure the <classname>MKOrchestra</classname>.</para>

<sect2 id="MakingAMKSynthPatchToDoSoundProcessing">
<title>Making a <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> to do Sound
Processing</title>

<para>Making a <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> that does sound
processing is simple.  You just include an instance of In1aUG to get
the left sound input channel or In1bUG to get the right sound input
channel.  These <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>s write their
input to an output patchpoint.  They also optionally provide a scale
factor.  Thus, you can convert the <classname>MKWaveTable</classname>
synthesis <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> described above to a
sound processing synthpatch by merely replacing the oscillator with an
In1aUG.</para>
</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="CreatingAMKUnitGeneratorSubclass">
<title>Creating a <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname> Subclass</title>

<para>Each <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname> subclass is an
object-oriented interface to a DSP macro, called a <emphasis>unit
generator</emphasis>, that's written in DSP56001 assembly language.
The Objective-C code in the subclass is generated automatically from a
DSP macro by the <command>dspwrap</command> program.  To
build your own <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname> subclass that
you can use in <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> design, you run
<command>dspwrap</command> on a DSP56001 assembly
language macro that you've created.  In addition, you can modify and
wrap the DSP macros that NeXT provides as source code in the directory
<filename class=directory>/usr/local/lib/dsp/ugsrc</filename>.</para>

<para>The design of DSP assembly language macros is outside the scope
of the present discussion.  The following sections show how to use
<command>dspwrap</command> and how to further modify the
<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>s that it creates.</para>

<sect2 id="Usingdspwrap">
<title>Using <command>dspwrap</command></title>

<para>The <command>dspwrap</command> program is used to
create array processing C functions as well as
<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname> subclasses.  To indicate that
you want to create the latter, you call the program with the <emphasis
role="bold">-ug</emphasis> switch followed by the name of the file
that contains the assembly code macro (you must include the
&ldquo;.asm&rdquo; extension when specifying the file).  For example,
the invocation</para>

<programlisting>
dspwrap -ug unoisehp.asm
</programlisting>

<para>creates a master <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname> class
called UnoisehpUG as well as the appropriate leaf classes.  These are
embodied in the following files, which are automatically generated by
<command>dspwrap</command>:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><filename>UnoisehpUG.m</filename> is the
implementation file of the master class.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para><filename class=headerfile>UnoisehpUG.h</filename> is the master class interface file.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para><filename>UnoisehpUGx.m</filename> and
<filename>UnoisehpUGy.m</filename> are leaf class implementations.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para><filename class=headerfile>UnoisehpUGx.h</filename>
and <filename class=headerfile>UnoisehpUGy.h</filename> are the leaf
interface files.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para><filename>unoisehpUGInclude.m</filename> is imported
by the master class.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>The number of leaf classes that are created depends on the
number of address-valued memory arguments, described below, in the
macro: A different leaf class is created for each combination of x and
y DSP memory spaces.  The <emphasis role="bold">unoisehp</emphasis>
macro, which implements a high-pass random number generator, has only
one such argument&horbar;its output&horbar;so two leaf classes are
generated, one for either memory space.</para>

<para>Some other files, such as documentation and DSP assembler and
linker files, are also created.  These can be moved, deleted, or
disregarded as you see fit.  For the present purposes, only the files
listed above are important.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="ModifyingTheClass">
<title>Modifying the Class</title>

<para>There are two basic reasons to modify a
<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname> class that's generated by
<command>dspwrap</command>:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>To set the values of the DSP memory arguments that are passed to the macro</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>To define the class's response to some common messages</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Of the files generated by <command>dspwrap</command>, you should
modify only those that define the master class.  In other words,
continuing with the Unoisehp example, only
<filename>UnoisehpUG.m</filename> and <filename
class=headerfile>UnoisehpUG.h</filename> should be edited.  The entire
implementation file of the UnoisehpUG master class as generated by
<command>dspwrap</command> is shown below:</para>

<programlisting>
#import &lt;MusicKit/MusicKit.h&gt;
#import "UnoisehpUG.h"
@implementation UnoisehpUG:MKUnitGenerator

/* DSP memory arguments. */
enum args { aout, seed};
#import "unoisehpUGInclude.m"
</programlisting>

<sect3 id="SettingTheArguments">
<title>Setting the Arguments</title>

<para>The two <emphasis role="bold">enum</emphasis> variables shown
above, <emphasis role="bold">aout</emphasis> and <emphasis
role="bold">seed</emphasis>, are DSP memory arguments.  A memory
argument represents a location on the DSP from which the unit
generator that's executing can read information sent to it by the
MusicKit.  There are two types of memory arguments:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Address-valued arguments administer the location in
DSP memory from which, or to which, the executing unit generator reads
or writes data.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>Datum-valued arguments take a value that's used as
part of the unit generator's computation.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>In the example, <emphasis role="bold">aout</emphasis> variable
is an address-valued argument that represents the
<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>'s output patchpoint.  We create
a Unoisehp method named <emphasis role="bold">setOutput:</emphasis>
that sets this argument:</para>

<programlisting>
-setOutput:outputPatchPoint
{
    return [self setAddressArg:aout to:outputPatchPoint];
}
</programlisting>

<para>The <emphasis role="bold">setAddressArg:to:</emphasis> method is
defined by <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname> to set an
address-valued DSP memory argument.</para>

<para>The other <emphasis role="bold">enum</emphasis> variable,
<emphasis role="bold">seed</emphasis>, is a datum-valued memory
argument.  It's set through <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>'s
<emphasis role="bold">setDatumArg:to:</emphasis> method, as
demonstrated in our implementation of Unoisehp's <emphasis
role="bold">setSeed:</emphasis>method:</para>

<programlisting>
-setSeed:(int)aSeed
{
    return [self setDatumArg:seed to:aSeed];
}
</programlisting>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="DefiningTheClassResponse">
<title>Defining the Class's Response</title>

<para>During a performance, a <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>
can expect to receive the following messages:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">run</emphasis> tells the receiver to begin doing whatever it does.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">finish</emphasis> winds down the receiver before coming to a halt.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">idle</emphasis> provides instructions for halting the receiver's activity.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Invocations of these methods were shown in the implementations
of the Simplicity and Envy <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>es.
Remember that <emphasis role="bold">finish</emphasis> returns the
amount of time the <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname> needs to
complete its mission&horbar;the amount of time to wait before
<emphasis role="bold">idle</emphasis> should be sent.  The default
implementations of these methods can be sufficient.  For further
tuning, you should implement, in your master class, the methods
<emphasis role="bold">runSelf</emphasis>, <emphasis
role="bold">finishSelf</emphasis>, and <emphasis
role="bold">idleSelf</emphasis>&horbar;methods that are automatically
invoked when the corresponding performance messages are
received.</para>

<para>You almost always provide an implementation of <emphasis
role="bold">idleSelf</emphasis> to ensure that your
<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname> is brought to a halt in a
manner befitting its activity.  The Unoisehp implementation of this
method sets its output to the DSP's <emphasis>sink</emphasis>, a
location that, by convention, is never read:</para>

<programlisting>
-idleSelf
{
    /* Set the output (aout) to sink. */
    [self setAddressArgToSink:aout];
    return self;
}
