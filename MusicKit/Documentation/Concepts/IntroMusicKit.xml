      <title>MusicKit Introduction</title>

      <para>
The <productname>MusicKit</productname> defines a set of Objective C
classes and informal protocols, C functions, and assorted constants
and data types that are useful for creating music, sound,
<acronym>DSP</acronym> and <acronym>MIDI</acronym> applications under
<productname>NeXTSTEP</productname>,
<productname>OpenStep</productname>,
<productname>Windows9X</productname>, <productname>MacOS
X</productname> and <productname>MacOS X-Server V1.2</productname>.
</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
The <productname>MusicKit</productname> provides a set of music
representation classes&horbar;most notably
<classname>MKNote</classname>, <classname>MKPart</classname> and
<classname>MKScore</classname>, as well as
<classname>MKEnvelope</classname>, <classname>MKWaveTable</classname>,
<classname>MKTimbre</classname>, and
<classname>MKPartial</classname>s&horbar;that provide a flexible
high-level structure for musical data. The
<productname>MusicKit</productname> also provides a number of file
formats for storing these structures. <emphasis>ScoreFile</emphasis>
is a simple text-based scripting language that allows musical data to
be represented in a convenient, human-readable form and supports
simple programming structures. Alternatively, the
<productname>MusicKit</productname> supports reading and writing
musical data as Standard <acronym>MIDI</acronym> files, binary
scorefiles (called &ldquo;playscore files&rdquo; for historical
reasons) and <productname>NeXTSTEP</productname> archived objects. The
<productname>MusicKit</productname>'s representation system includes a
number of enormously valuable features. The <varname>noteTag</varname>
construct supports representation of phrase structure and makes it
easy to create effects such as legato, which require continuity from
one note to the next. The <constant>noteUpdate</constant> construct
allows any aspect of a sounding note to be changed at any time.
</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>
The <productname>MusicKit</productname> makes scheduling and
sequencing extremely simple. A <productname>MusicKit</productname>
"performance" consists of sending scheduled Objective-C messages and
handling asynchronous events such as incoming <acronym>MIDI</acronym>
and <productname>NeXTSTEP</productname> events. The
<classname>MKConductor</classname> class is in charge of dispatching
all messages and managing the notion of time. A
<classname>MKConductor</classname> may have a tempo, a time map, or
may be set to synchronize to <acronym>MIDI</acronym> time code. Since
all time control is managed in the <classname>MKConductor</classname>
itself, the difference between these time representations is
completely transparent.
</para>
	  <para>
Another aspect of the <productname>MusicKit</productname> performance
is a dynamically patchable <classname>MKNote</classname>-handling
network consisting of three classes,
<classname>MKPerformer</classname>s,
<classname>MKNoteFilter</classname>s and
<classname>MKInstrument</classname>s.
<classname>MKPerformer</classname> subclasses are
<classname>MKNote</classname>-generators, that sequence over
<classname>NSArray</classname>s of <classname>MKNote</classname>s or
create <classname>MKNote</classname>s on the fly. They contain outputs
that may be connected to <classname>MKNoteFilter</classname>s or
<classname>MKInstrument</classname>s. <classname>MKInstrument</classname>
subclasses realize <classname>MKNote</classname>s in some manner, for
example by playing them on the <acronym>DSP</acronym> or via
<acronym>MIDI</acronym>, and contain inputs that may be connected to
<classname>MKNoteFilter</classname>s or
<classname>MKPerformer</classname>s. <classname>MKNoteFilter</classname>s
are intermediate processors that contain both inputs and outputs. This
scheme makes it easy to create a performance scheme for nearly any
application.  The inputs and outputs are represented as
<classname>MKNoteSender</classname>s and
<classname>MKNoteReceiver</classname>s, respectively.
</para>
	  <para>
The <productname>MusicKit</productname>'s performance apparatus is
based on the notion that messages execute quickly. Thus, time stays
constant during the execution of a scheduled or event-triggered
message. This has the advantage of allowing a large number of
<acronym>DSP</acronym> updates to happen at the exact same time. The
<acronym>DSP</acronym> and <acronym>MIDI</acronym> driver support
time-ordered queues of events, thus allowing the application some
latitude in computing these updates, while still providing an
instantaneous execution of the updates themselves.
</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>
The <productname>MusicKit</productname> has extensive support for
sound processing and synthesis on multiple <acronym>DSP</acronym>
chips. Instances of the <classname>MKOrchestra</classname> class
correspond to <acronym>DSP</acronym> chips and manage dynamic memory
and processing time allocation. Full dynamic loading during a
performance is supported. Synthesis insruments are represented as
<classname>MKSynthPatch</classname> subclasses. The
<productname>MusicKit</productname> SynthPatch library is an auxiliary
library that consists solely of <classname>MKSynthPatch</classname>
subclasses, each of which implements a generic synthesis
technique. For developers or composers who want to create their own
synthesis or processing configuration, the
<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname> class is provided. Each
<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname> subclass corresponds to a
<acronym>DSP</acronym> module such as a filter, oscillator, or delay
unit. By interconnecting these <classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname>s
using "patchpoints", a huge variety of synthesis and processing
techniques may be implemented.  The
<productname>MusicKit</productname> UnitGenerator library is an
auxilliary library that consists solely of
<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname> subclasses. Finally,
adventurous developers may write their own <acronym>DSP</acronym> unit
generators in <hardware>MC56001</hardware> assembly language (using
an extensive set of macros to simplify the process) and use the tool
<command>dspwrap</command> to automatically generate Objective-C
<classname>MKUnitGenerator</classname> subclasses.
</para>
	  <para>
Currently, only the <hardware>MC56001</hardware> is supported. The
<classname>ArielQP</classname> and <classname>ArielQPSat</classname>
classes support the Ariel QuintProcessor hardware, available for the
<productname>NeXTcube</productname>.

      <para>
The following sections briefly describe the topics that the 
Kit addresses through its classes and protocols. Within the descriptions, 
class and protocol names are highlighted as they're introduced 
for easy identification.
</para>

      <sect2 id="EncapsulatingMusicalData">
	<title>Encapsulating Musical Data</title>

	<para>
Music is represented in a three-level hierarchy of
<classname>MKScore</classname>, <classname>MKPart</classname>,
and <classname>MKNote</classname>
objects. <classname>MKScore</classname>s and
<classname>MKPart</classname>s are analogous to orchestral scores
and the instrumental parts that they contain: a
<classname>MKScore</classname> represents a musical composition
while each <classname>MKPart</classname> corresponds to a
particular means of realization. <classname>MKParts</classname>
consists of a time-sorted collection of
<classname>MKNote</classname>s, each of which contains data that
describes a musical event.
</para>

	<para>
The information in a <classname>MKNote</classname> object falls
into four categories:
</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
A list of attribute-value pairs called <emphasis>parameters</emphasis> 
that describe the characteristics of a musical event
</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
A <varname>noteType</varname> that determines the general character 
of the <classname>MKNote</classname>
</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
An identifying integer called a <varname>noteTag</varname>, used to 
associate different <classname>MKNote</classname>s with each other
</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
A <varname>timeTag</varname>, or the onset time of the
<classname>MKNote</classname>
</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>
A parameter supplies a value for a particular attribute of a musical
sound, its frequency or amplitude, for example. A parameter's value
can be simple&horbar;an integer, floating point number, or character
string&horbar;or it can be another object. The
<classname>MKNote</classname> object provides special methods for
setting the value of a parameter as an
<classname>MKEnvelope</classname> object or a
<classname>MKWaveTable</classname> object. With the
<classname>MKEnvelope</classname> object you can create a value that
varies over time. The <classname>MKWaveTable</classname> object
contains sound or spectrum data that's used in various types of
synthesis, such as wavetable synthesis.
</para>

	<para>
The manner in which a parameter is interpreted depends
on the object that realizes the <classname>MKNote</classname>. For
example, one object could interpret a heightened brightness parameter
by increasing the amplitude of the sound, while another, given the
same <classname>MKNote</classname>, might increase the sound's spectral
content. In this way, parameters are similar to Objective-C messages:
The precise meaning of either depends on how they are implemented by
the object that receives them.
</para>

	<para>
A <classname>MKNote</classname>'s <varname>noteType</varname> and
<varname>noteTag</varname> are used together to help interpret a
<classname>MKNote</classname>'s parameters. There are five
<varname>noteType</varname>s:
</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
<constant>noteDur</constant> represents an entire musical note (a note 
with a duration).
</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
<constant>noteOn</constant> establishes the beginning of a note.
</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
<constant>noteOff</constant> establishes the end of a note.
</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
<constant>noteUpdate</constant> represents the middle of a note.
</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
<constant>mute</constant> represents a <classname>MKNote</classname>
not directly associated with sound-production.
</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>
<constant>noteDur</constant>s and <constant>noteOn</constant>s both
establish the beginning of a musical note. The difference between them
is that the <constant>noteDur</constant> also has information that
tells when the note should end. A note created by a
<constant>noteOn</constant> simply keeps sounding until a
<constant>noteOff</constant> comes along to stop it. In either case, a
<constant>noteUpdate</constant> can change the attributes of a musical
note while it's sounding. The <constant>mute</constant>
<varname>noteType</varname> is used to represent any additional
information, such as barlines or rehearsal numbers.
</para>

	<para>
A <varname>noteTag</varname> is an arbitrary integer that's used to
identify different <classname>MKNote</classname>s as part of the same musical note or
phrase. For example, a <constant>noteOff</constant> is paired with a
<constant>noteOn</constant> by matching <varname>noteTag</varname>
values.  You can create a legato passage with a series of
<constant>noteOn</constant>s, all with the same
<varname>noteTag</varname>, concluded by a single
<constant>noteOff</constant>.
</para>

	<para>
The <productname>MusicKit</productname>'s <varname>noteTag</varname>
system solves many of the problems inherent in
<acronym>MIDI</acronym>, which uses a combination of key number and
channel to identify events that are part of the same musical
phrase. For example, the <productname>MusicKit</productname> can
create and manage an unlimited number of simultaneous legato phrases
while <acronym>MIDI</acronym> can only manage 16 (in
<acronym>MIDI</acronym> mono mode). Also, with
<acronym>MIDI</acronym>'s tagging system, mixing streams of notes is
difficult&horbar;notes can easily get clobbered or linger on beyond
their appointed end. The <productname>MusicKit</productname> avoids
this problem by reassigning unique <varname>noteTag</varname> values
when streams of <classname>MKNote</classname>s are mixed together.
</para>

	<para>
A <classname>MKNote</classname>'s <varname>timeTag</varname> is
relevant only when the <classname>MKNote</classname> is in a
<classname>MKPart</classname>&horbar;it specifies the time of the
<classname>MKNote</classname> relative to the start of its
<classname>MKPart</classname>. <varname>timeTag</varname> values are
measured in beats, where the value of a beat can be set by the
user. If the <classname>MKNote</classname> is a noteDur, its duration
is also computed in beats.
</para>

	<para>
An entire <classname>MKScore</classname> can be stored in a
scorefile. The scorefile format is designed to represent any
information that can be put in a <classname>MKNote</classname> object,
including the <classname>MKPart</classname> to which the
<classname>MKNote</classname> belongs. Scorefiles are in ASCII format
and can easily be created and modified with a text editor. In
addition, the <productname>MusicKit</productname> provides a language called
<emphasis>ScoreFile</emphasis> that lets you add simple programming
constructs such as variables, assignments, and arithmethic expressions
to your scorefile.
</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="Scheduling">
	<title>Note and Event Scheduling, Sequencing and Processing</title>

	<para>
During a <productname>MusicKit</productname> performance,
<classname>MKNote</classname> objects are dispatched, in time order,
to objects that realize them in some manner&horbar;usually by making a
sound on the <acronym>DSP</acronym> or on an external
<acronym>MIDI</acronym> synthesizer. This process involves, primarily,
instances of <classname>MKPerformer</classname>,
<classname>MKInstrument</classname>, and
<classname>MKConductor</classname>:
</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
A <classname>MKPerformer</classname> acquires
<classname>MKNote</classname>s, either by opening a file, looking
in a <classname>MKPart</classname> or
<classname>MKScore</classname>, or generating them itself, and
sends them to one or more <classname>MKInstrument</classname>s.
Pseudo-performers such as <classname>MKMidi</classname> or the
application itself may act as <classname>MKPerformer</classname>s,
supplying <classname>MKNote</classname>s in response to
asynchronous events.
</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
An <classname>MKInstrument</classname> receives
<classname>MKNote</classname>s sent to it by one or more
<classname>MKPerformer</classname>s and realizes them in some
distinct manner.
</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
The <classname>MKConductor</classname> acts as a scheduler,
ensuring that <classname>MKNote</classname>s are transmitted from
<classname>MKPerformer</classname>s to
<classname>MKInstruments</classname> in order and at the right
time.
</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>
This system is useful for designing a wide variety of applications
that process <classname>MKNote</classname>s sequentially. For example,
a <productname>MusicKit</productname> performance can be configured to
perform <acronym>MIDI</acronym> or <acronym>DSP</acronym> sequencing,
graphic animation, <acronym>MIDI</acronym> real-time processing (such
as echo, channel mapping, or doubling), sequential editing on a file,
mixing and filtering of <classname>MKNote</classname> streams under
interactive control, and so on.
</para>

	<para>
Both <classname>MKPerformer</classname> and
<classname>MKInstrument</classname> are abstract classes.  This
means that you never create and use instances of these classes
directly in an application. Rather, they define common protocol (for
sending and receiving <classname>MKNote</classname>s) that's used
by their subclasses. The subclasses build on this protocol to generate
or realize <classname>MKNote</classname>s in some
application-specific manner.
</para>

The <productname>MusicKit</productname> provides a number of
<classname>MKPerformer</classname> and

<classname>MKNoteFilter</classname> is a subclass of

<classname>MKNote</classname>-sending protocol, thus it can both
receive and send <classname>MKNote</classname>s. Any number of
<classname>MKNoteFilter</classname> objects can be interposed between
a <classname>MKPerformer</classname> and an
<classname>MKInstrument</classname>. <classname>MKNoteFilter</classname>
is, itself, abstract.  The action a
<classname>MKNoteFilter</classname> object takes in response to
receiving a <classname>MKNote</classname> is defined by the
subclass. For example, you can create a
<classname>MKNoteFilter</classname> subclass that creates and
activates a new <classname>MKPerformer</classname> for every
<classname>MKNote</classname> it receives.
