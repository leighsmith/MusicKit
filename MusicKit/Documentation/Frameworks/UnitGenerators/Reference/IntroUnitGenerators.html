<i>Music Kit UnitGenerators Library</i>

<br>
UnitGenerators have two types of state:	<br>
<br>
&#183;	<i>memory arguments</i> describe the UnitGenerator state
and are assumed to be relatively slowly-changing and not necessarily at a
constant sampling rate.   They can be updated, at the fastest, at the audio
sampling rate divided by the "tick size" (which is 16 on the
DSP56001).<br>
<br>
&#183;	<i>patchpoints </i>represent the signal connections
between UnitGenerators.   They are accessed at a constant sampling rate, which
is the same as the audio sampling rate.  <br>
<br>
The Music Kit UnitGenerator library supplies the following classes:
