  <para>
The MusicKit is an object-oriented software system for building
music, sound, signal processing, and MIDI applications.  It has been used
in such diverse commercial applications as music sequencers, computer
games, and document processors.  Professors and students in academia
have used the MusicKit in a host of areas, including music
performance, scientific experiments, computer-aided instruction, and
physical modeling.  The MusicKit was the first to unify the MIDI and
Music V paradigms, thus combining interaction with generality.  (Music
V, written by Max Mathews and others at Bell Labs four decades ago,
was the first widely available "computer music compiler".)
   </para>

   <para>
The NeXT MusicKit was first demonstrated at the 1988
NeXT product introduction and was bundled in NeXT software releases
1.0 and 2.0.  Beginning with NeXT's 3.0 release, the MusicKit was no
longer part of the standard NeXT software release.  Instead, it was
being distributed and supported by the Center for Computer  Research
in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA) of Stanford University. Since 1999 and
version 5.0, the most recent releases run on several more 
<link linkend="platforms">popular operating systems</link>.
These releases have been generously supported by my employer,

The <link linkend="availability">MusicKit Distribution</link> is a
comprehensive package that includes on-line documentation, <link
linkend=examples>programming examples</link>, <link
linkend=applications>utilities, applications</link> and sample score
documents. The MusicKit is dependent on the SndKit distribution,
originally written by Stephen Brandon, and both Framework collections
are available at the same distribution site.
</para>

<para>
Source code is available for everything, with
the exception of the NeXT hardware implementation of the low-level
sound and DSP drivers.  This means researchers and developers may
study the source or even customize the Music Kit and DSP Tools to suit
their needs.  Enhancements can be sent to 
<email>leigh@tomandandy.com</email>
to have them incorporated for future releases. Commercial software
developers may freely incorporate and adapt the software to accelerate
development of software products.

      <title>Windows support</title>
      <para>
After much fun with the pinnacle of Microsoft development tools, we
have the MusicKit working on Windows9X. The solution was to emulate
the Mach MIDI device driver with the core layer of DirectMusic. There
is a fairly similar match in functionality between these API.
</para>
      <para>
The downloadable sound (DLS) capability of DirectMusic (providing a
MIDI oriented sample playback API to PC soundcards) is also supported
when playing to a DirectMusic software synthesiser. There is minimal
but usable support for downloading new DLS instruments to the software
synthesiser.

While the future
of Apple's OpenStep/YellowBox/Cocoa/WebObjects (!) for Windows support
is far from clear, the combination of Gnu technologies of <ulink
url="http://www.gnustep.org">GnuStep</ulink> and <ulink
url="http://www.cygnus.com/cygwin">cygwin</ulink> would suggest in the
near future that Apple's corporate interests will not dictate whether
applications can be deployed on either platform.

    <para>
David A. Jaffe <email>david@jaffe.com</email> and Julius O. Smith
III at NeXT did the original design, with David coding the Objective C
and Julius most of the 56K DSP. Their original design appeared in
<citation>JaffeBoynton89</citation>.
The Ensemble application and much of the SynthPatch
library were written by Michael Mcnabb.   Douglas Fulton had primary
responsibility  for the documentation. Dana Massie, James A. Moorer,
Lee Boynton, Greg Kellogg, Douglas Keislar, Michael Minnick, Perry
Cook, John Strawn, Rob Poor and Roger Dannenberg made code and design
contributions also. Following NeXT's release of the source to Stanford
in 1994, David did the port to Intel NeXTStep and the MPU-401 MIDI and
DSP drivers. There were some other bug fix contributors (acknowledged
in code comments).
</para> 

    <para>
Stephen Brandon <email>sbrandon@music.gla.ac.uk</email> did the initial
OpenStep port in early 1998 and the majority of the conversion
work. Leigh M. Smith <email>leigh@cs.uwa.edu.au</email>, now
<email>leigh@tomandandy.com</email> fixed bugs and ported the MusicKit
and MIDI drivers to Intel and PowerPC Rhapsody in late 1998 and
reorganised the packages and documentation for MacOS X-Server. The port
from Rhapsody to MacOS X-Server was trivial.  The frameworks were then
ported to Windows 98/NT using DirectMusic, with DirectSound interface
code contributed by SKoT McDonald <email>skot@tomandandy.com</email>. The
MusicKit now uses the SndKit, written by Stephen Brandon, rather than
the SoundKit for its sound processing. Keith Hamel tested and helped
in bug fixes for the MacOS X-Server version.

    <title>Version numbering of the MusicKit</title>

    <para>
Version numbering of the MusicKit is as follows.
</para>

    <para>
All versions are numbered in the popular standard GNU nomenclature
<replaceable>V.R.P</replaceable>, referred here as a <emphasis>version
tuple</emphasis>, referring to <replaceable>Version</replaceable>,
<replaceable>Revision</replaceable> and
<replaceable>Patch</replaceable>
respectively. <replaceable>Version</replaceable> refers to major
milestones in a project, such as a complete rewrite or major internal
conversion, major functional improvement etc.
<replaceable>Revision</replaceable>, refers to a minor milestone that
can include new functionality that may break external interfacing
software, forcing them to be updated (minimally a recompile).
<replaceable>Patch</replaceable>, refers to a singular bug fix to
correct operation which does not cause an incompatible change or
introduce new behaviour.
</para>

    <para>
Each framework has it's own version tuple. This is encoded in the
framework and is used by the dynamic loader to verify the correct
versions of applications link against the correct versions of
frameworks. However, to allow new framework with patches to be
installed into operational sites without forcing recompiles of the
application, the version tuple encoded in the framework is of the form
<replaceable>V.R</replaceable>.

    <title>What works?</title>
    <para>
The frameworks have been exercised fairly extensively and seem quite
stable. MIDI recording and playback of scores and computed parts works
on all supported platforms. The examples
<application>MIDIFilePlayback</application> and
<command>playscorefilemidi</command> and the utility
<command>playscore</command> demonstrate these capabilities.

At the moment, there is no single make operation to build the entire

</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
Compile and install <filename>MKUnitGenerators</filename> and
<filename>MKSynthPatches</filename> frameworks if running on
OpenStep. These frameworks won't compile on MacOS X-Server because the
Motorola <command>asm56000</command> and <command>lnk56000</command>
tools are missing. I've asked Apple and Motorola for a MacOS X-Server
port, why don't you also? :-) In theory the 56K assembler runs on
Windows, so it may be possible to run these on Windows, but that is
yet to be tested.
</para>
      <para>
The frameworks will install into <filename
class=directory>/Local/Library/Frameworks</filename> on MacOS
X-Server, <filename

To compile the MacOS X-Server Zilog SCC MIDI driver, some header files
are missing.  You can get them from the Darwin distribution of the
SoundKit or just copy them from a NeXTStep 3.3/OpenStep 4.2 system.

DSP on non-56K DSP systems. Stephen mentioned he got sound out under
OS4.2. However none of the dsp drivers have been ported from NeXTStep
V3.3 (as they are all ISA bus cards and I don't know of a PCI 56K card
with published interface specs).

A more fruitful avenue seems to be to convert the unit generators to
the MPEG Layer 4 structured audio language <ulink
url="http://www.saol.net">SAOL</ulink>
<citation>ScheirerVercoe99</citation> and modify the MKDSP framework
to download to a supporting card or do the emulation using the native
processor.  If emulating with the native processor, it would then be
possible to use Apples AltiVec vector libraries for increased
performance.

Documentation is currently in Rich Text Format (RTF). Beginning with
this README document, the documentation has begun to be converted to
the SGML DocBook DTD used by the Linux Documentation Project and the
class documentation to be incorporated into the sourcefiles with
<application>HeaderDoc</application> tags.
</para>

<para>
Anyone who has access to a commercial RTF to SGML converter can make
a very helpful contribution here!  The documentation is about half
converted and updated to the new naming convention and OpenStep
behaviour and needs to be completed.

For this current revision the .nibs have been upgraded to work with
MacOS X and MacOS X-Server and will not load with OpenStep 4.2. The
.nibs which are compatible with OpenStep 4.2 are now named
nibname-openstep.nib. At the moment you will need to manually
symbolically link these to compile for OpenStep 4.2. Eventually Apple's
InterfaceBuilder will produce XML based nibs which should reduce the
compatibility issue.

Please! I am maintaining changes via a closed CVS system (<systemitem
class="systemname">cvs.tomandandy.com</systemitem>) at the moment,
since sourceforge does not provide a CVS which supports -t/-f wrappers
enabling .nib support. If you send me
<email>leigh@tomandandy.com</email> changes I will incorporate them
and check them in. If you are planning to do major work, I can provide
access to the CVS server. The long-term goal is to make the CVS tree
fully available to all interested developers, please help!
